## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How long will implementation take?**
A: 8-12 weeks for v1.0 (full merge + launch). See Plan-C for detailed timeline.

**Q: Do I need Docker?**
A: Yes, Dev Container is critical for consistent environment. See Plan-F for setup.

**Q: What about MCP servers?**
A: Plan-E explains everything. You either copy azure-pricing-mcp from azure-agentic-infraops or build your own. See Plan-E Part 3 for both options.

**Q: What if I only want certain parts?**
A: Each component is modular. See Plan-D for v1.1+ expansion details.

**Q: How much coding?**
A: Most v1.0 is integration/adaptation (existing agents + MCP setup). See Plan-C Sprint 5-6 for coding tasks.

**Q: Team size?**
A: 2-3 people for v1.0. See Plan-C for role requirements.
