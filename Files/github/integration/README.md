# Integration Guides

This folder holds coordination docs that glue agents, MCP servers, and artifacts together. Each doc is intentionally concise and cross-references the relevant Plan documents.

- workflow-orchestrator.md — how phases, handoffs, and artifacts flow.
- mcp-server-manager.md — how MCP servers are started, monitored, and recovered.
- artifact-manager.md — where artifacts live per phase and how they are named/versioned.
