# .github/skills

Skill specification files (markdown) live here in the Plan-C target structure.

Status:
- Runtime skill implementations and templates may live elsewhere depending on the component.

Next:
- Populate this folder with the 9 v1.0 skill specs (see Files/AgenticCoderPlan/AgenticCoderPlan-B.md and Plan-C Part 3).
