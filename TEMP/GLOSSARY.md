## A

### Agent
A specialized autonomous software module that performs a specific task in code generation. AgenticCoder has 26 agents organized in 3 tiers (Orchestration, Architecture, Implementation, DevOps). Each agent uses specific skills to accomplish its goal.

**Example**: `@react-specialist` is an agent that generates React component code.

**Related**: [Skill](#skill), [Handoff](#handoff)

### Activation
The process of determining when an agent should execute based on project specifications. Agents have activation conditions (e.g., "activate when frontend == 'React'").

**Example**: The `@react-specialist` activates only when React is the chosen frontend framework.

### Artifact
A versioned output generated by an agent. Artifacts include source code, configuration files, documentation, and test files. Each artifact has metadata tracking its creator, version, and dependencies.

**Example**: The React specialist generates artifacts like `App.tsx`, `components.tsx`, and test files.

**Related**: [Versioning](#versioning), [Option C](#option-c)

### Architecture Tier
